VideoCapture App
================

The VideoCapture app is a Mac app that is meant to interface with the existing 
[FinchScope](https://github.com/WALIII/FinchScope/) project in order to
do realtime recording and processing of video and audio from the orthophysiology rig.

The project interfaces with the Finchscope in order to:

* Capture video and audio via a USB video grabber.
* Control the Finschscope, including LED brightness and camera power, via serial communication to an Arduino board.
